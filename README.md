# CAGE
A simulation, a game that leads you into darkness. 

------------------------------------------

INSPIRATION

You know how tech billionaires are viewed as gods among humans and claim that life itself is a simulation? Well, if life truly is a simulation, then that implies a Grand Creator. This thought led me to the very depths of my subconcious - if life is a simulation, then what am I? 

An NPC (Non-playable Character)? Or am I a protagonist of my own simulation? Are the people in my life NPCs? In which ways can I interact with them?
Absolute madness.

From a more technical standpoint, it's inspired by old, terminal-based adventure games, as well as a modern indie game series, Hotline Miami 1 & 2. It's ruthlessness, the almost 0 checkpoints and "get killed instantly" features amazed me, but forced something out of me that I never knew existed - persistence. And don't even get me started on the soundtrack. Oh boy, oh boy - that soundtrack could turn an innocent man into a ruthless serial killer, which the game succeeds to do. But, it's just a game. A simulation.

Why CAGE (etimology)?

"I'm the man in the box. Buried in my shit.", said Layne Staley from Alice In Chains. CAGE is somewhat based on the Allegory of the Cave, in which the player struggles to get out of (her/his/whichever gender pronoun you might prefer)'s cave, see what out's out there - knowledge that some perceive as forbidden. It helps you reach the apple that Eve bit into, and ironically is written in Python.

Why Python?

You see, I've struggled for years on end to learn C++, a programming language forced in the institutional facility I dropped out of (mostly due to shite finances). However, I've also been teaching myself how to code in Python, a language I've been undisciplined with. 

TL;DR There's simply not enough time on this Earth to learn C++ syntax. Hopefully, one fateful day, I'll retire and learn how to make the coolest stuff in a very powerful language, such as C++.

------------------------------------------

Why are you making this game?

Because I want to. Because I want to practice by making things, as opposed to just reading about how to make things. I am tired of being a watchful observer.

------------------------------------------

Can I contribute?

Yes, as long as it doesn't make the game easier to play.
